Kansas City Chiefs have both won more and participated in more total Super Bowls than the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. but the buccaneers have a chance if they can read the chiefs mvp

based on the location the most losses occur in the rose bowl, orange bow, and louisiana super dome. from that i can see that florida as a state usually sees more wins than kansas overall.

I believe buccaneers will win the because of the overall experience they have over the cheifs. we can expect a good match and honestly its anyones game.
